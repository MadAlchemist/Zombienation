* Added cactus farm structure;
* Added Heisenberg - hazmat zombie with special buff/debuff combo that always infects;
* Added Pricky - zombie villager with special buff/debuff combo that can insta-gib most players;
* Added composite bricks. Alloy of netherrack and end stone (uncraftable at this moment), is really
  hard to break even with netherite pickaxe but can be blown up.

  Can be blown up if necessary, but is as hard to break manually as composite bricks;

* (hopefully) fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBounds crash on chesthead deaths;
